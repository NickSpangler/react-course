Library or Framework?
- Framwork -> larger than JS libraries
- Frameworks are opinionated. 

React is LESS feature-rich, lighter weight. On its OWN, it's just a library
    - it really only becomes a framework when you ADD things, like react-router, redux, etc.

COMPONENTS
- The building blocks of React
- PIeces of UI and view logic
